/*

Problem statement
You have been given an unsorted array ‘ARR’.

Your task is to sort the array in such a way that the array looks like a wave array.

Example:
If the given sequence ‘ARR’ has ‘N’ elements then the sorted wave array looks like - 
‘ARR[0] >= ARR[1]’ and ‘ARR[1] <= ARR[2]’
‘ARR[2] >= ARR[3]’ and ‘ARR[3] <= ARR[4]’
‘ARR[4] >= ARR[5]’ and ‘ARR[5] <= ARR[6]’  And so on.



Sample Input 1:
2
5 
2 3 1 4 2
6
4 3 2 5 4 1
Sample Output 1:
2 1 3 2 4
4 3 5 2 4 1
Explanation of sample input 1:
Test Case 1:
For given 'ARR' = { 2, 3, 1, 4, 2 } one possible sorted wave form array is { 2, 1, 3, 2, 4 }
